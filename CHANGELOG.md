## [0.10.0] - 2026-02-10 - Feedback Fix + Co-Builder Launch + Mobile

### 🐛 Critical Bug Fixes
- **Feedback submission completely broken** - Trigger function `generate_feedback_ticket_number()` failed: referenced `feedback_ticket_seq` without schema qualification + used `SECURITY INVOKER`. Fixed to `SECURITY DEFINER` with `public.feedback_ticket_seq`.
- **user_profiles query bug in 10 files** - All queries used `.eq('id', user.id)` instead of `.eq('user_id', user.id)`. The `id` column is an auto-generated PK, not the auth user UUID. Silently returned null profiles across feedback, help center, onboarding, config, feature-flags, audit, widgets, and request-access.
- **FK constraint mismatch on feedback_submissions** - `submitted_by`, `assigned_to`, `resolved_by` referenced `user_profiles(id)` instead of `user_profiles(user_id)`. Fixed all three.
- Corrected 4 email addresses for user auto-assign

### ✨ Features
- **Co-Builder Competition System** (15 users, Feb 12 - Mar 12, 2026)
  - 5 new tables + materialized view + RPC function + 13 seeded test scenarios
  - 7 sub-pages: My Feedback, Scenarios (list + detail), Top 5, Bug Tracker, Admin Panel, Admin Review
  - Point counter with toast notifications, competition feedback floating button
- **Mobile Responsiveness** - Full mobile support
  - `MobileSidebarProvider` context, drawer sidebar, hamburger menu, responsive layout
  - Floating buttons, point counter, viewport meta (no zoom)
- **Error Boundaries** - `error.tsx` and `not-found.tsx` with Indonesian text
- **User Auto-Assign** - Pre-assigned roles for 16 @gama-group.co users
- Excluded agency role from Co-Builder competition
